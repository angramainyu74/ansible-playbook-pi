# ansible-playbook-pi
Ansible playbooks for common Raspberry Pi setup and configuration tasks. Includes common tasks generally applicable to all pis (locale, tmux, disabling default swap and setting up zram and log2ram, etc.) as well as use-specific roles such as Pi-hole, murmur (Mumble server), samba, nginx, etc.

Main intent is to allow for very quick, easy, and consistent deployment of new pis or rebuild and reconfigure in case of failure.
